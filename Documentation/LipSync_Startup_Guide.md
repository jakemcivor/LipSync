LipSync

STARTUP GUIDE

**Version 1.5 / September 2019 www.MakersMakingChange.com**  

# About the LipSync 

The LipSync is a mouth operated joystick that allows a person who has limited or
no control of their hands and arms to control a cursor on a mobile phone, tablet
or computer using only head movement. It is an open source assistive technology
design by Makers Making Change, a program of the Neil Squire Society that
connects volunteer makers with people with disabilities to create more
affordable assistive technology.

Open source designs are freely released by their creators for people to make for
themselves, modify or incorporate in their own designs for free. Join the Makers

# <br> 1 Getting Started 

The LipSync requires the following items to get started:

-   A LipSync

-   Computing device (mobile phone, tablet, or laptop) which supports a USB
    mouse

-   External power bank (optional but recommended)

-   Mounting solution for securing the LipSync to a surface

Before plugging the LipSync, make sure of the following:

1.  Computing device is fully charged and/or uses an external power source (e.g.
    power bank).

2.  Computing device and LipSync are securely mounted to a stable surface.

3.  LipSync USB, adapter cable and external power source are plugged together
    (see Plugging the LipSync in this section)

## Mounting<br>

Wheelchair: Every wheelchair has different points available for mounting. Common
mounting points available on power wheelchairs are the headrest rail, back of
wheelchair, armrest rail, under chair cushion, chair rail, and footplate. Try
out different areas and see what works best. If you are not familiar with
mounts, consult with a local assistive technology professional.

Desk: Find a clear space on the front edge of your desk or table. Orient the
mount bracket toward the user being careful not to move the LipSync. Secure the
bracket and adjust the mounting arm so the LipSync is within easy reach. Tighten
the knob when the arm is in the desired position.

Checklist for after mounting:

-   Are the clamp and mount secure and do not move?

-   Is there clearance around the wheels, wires, and chair frame with the mount
    attached?

-   Does the wheelchair fit through doorways?

-   Is the driving view of the user clear with no obstructions?

-   Is the mobile device within viewing angle of the LipSync?

-   Can the user easily reach the LipSync to use it?

## Mobile Phone and Tablet Compatibility

>   Not all mobile phones and tablets support external pointing devices like the
>   LipSync or other mouse replacements. Apple iOS phones and tablets with iOS13
>   and iPadOS or higher, and only some Android mobile phones and tablets
>   support the LipSync. Check with the manufacturer before purchasing. Look to
>   see if your device supports “USB OTG HID” or “Universal Serial Bus On the Go
>   Human Interface Device” profile.

## External Power Bank

The LipSync can be powered using an external power supply like power bank of at
least 2700mAH or higher. This prevents the LipSync from drawing battery from
your mobile or tablet. The power bank is only supplying power to the LipSync and
the mobile or tablet will not be charged.

## Connecting the LipSync to a Device

### Plugging into a Computer, Laptop or Android & Windows Device

The order in which you connect the USB cables may affect how the LipSync
functions. Plug the cables in the following order:

1.  Connect the LipSync USB to the USB adapter cable’s receptacle.

2.  Connect the other end of the adapter into the computing device and external
    power source.

3.  Wait 3 seconds for the LipSync to initialize. Initialization is complete
    when the LED blinks red and green four times.

Note: If you are using a desktop or laptop the LipSync USB can be directly
plugged into the computer USB port.

### Plugging into an iOS Device

1.  Connect the LipSync USB to a USB hub’s receptacle.

2.  Connect the USB end of a USB to USB C/Lightning cable into the hub’s USB
    receptacle.

3.  Connect the other end of the USB to USB C/Lightning cable into the iOS
    device.

4.  Wait 3 seconds for the LipSync to initialize. Initialization is complete
    when the LED blinks red and green four times.

Supporting Applications

The Assistant Menu allows quick access to important functions that cannot be
accessed without physically touching the device, like the Home button, Back,
Zoom In and Out, Screen Capture, Volume, and Restart. Turn on the Assistant Menu
by going to **SETTING MY DEVICE ACCESSIBILITY DEXTERITY AND INTERACTION
ASSISTANT MENU.**  If your phone doesn’t have Assistant Menu, apps Back Button
or Handy Soft Keys can be downloaded.

A swiping action is required on some mobile device to unlock it. This can be
avoided by setting SCREEN LOCK in the Settings Menu is set to NONE.
Alternatively, an application called **Keep Screen On** can be downloaded from
the Android Play store. It will prevent the phone from going to sleep so it
doesn’t require a swipe to unlock. However, this will drain your phone battery
faster.

#  2 Using the LipSync

>   IMPORTANT: Allow 3 seconds for the LED initialization sequence  
>   to flash **each time** the LipSync is connected to a device before moving
>   the mouthpiece. Moving it before the 3 seconds is complete will affect the
>   usage.

## Speed Control

The LipSync has 11 speed control levels with the default level set to 5 when
first initialized.

To adjust the cursor sensitivity and speed, set the computing device’s cursor
speed to its slowest setting to start, then adjust the LipSync speed control
buttons until you get a speed that is comfortable for you. Press the up facing
triangular button on the back of the LipSync to increase the speed and the
downward facing button to decrease. If the speed is still not fast enough,
gradually increase the speed on the mobile device or computer.

# Troubleshooting 

Q: Why doesn’t the cursor appear on the screen when I plug in the LipSync?

**Solution 1:** Make a 5 second long puff to trigger the home position reset.

**Solution 2:** Wait 3 seconds for the LipSync to initialize. Moving the
mouthpiece before the 3 seconds is complete will affect the calibration.

**Solution 3:** If the cursor does not appear after 3 seconds, disconnect the
cable from the computing device, reconnect again, and let the LipSync initialize
for 3 seconds.

**Solution 4:** Perform the joystick calibration found on the follow page.

Q: Why does my cursor drift across the screen when I am not moving the LipSync?

**Solution 1:** Make a 5 second long puff to trigger the home position reset.

**Solution 2:** Wait 3 seconds for the LipSync to initialize. Moving the
mouthpiece before the 3 seconds is complete will affect the calibration.

**Solution 3:** If the cursor does not appear after 3 seconds, disconnect the
cable from the computing device, reconnect again, and let the LipSync initialize
for 3 seconds.

**Solution 4:** Perform the joystick calibration found on the follow page.
