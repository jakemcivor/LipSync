**LipSync Mouse: User Guide**

# Introduction

The LipSync is a sip-and-puff joystick that allows a user with limited or no arm
mobility to control their computer. It emulates a computer mouse and can perform
left click, right click, scroll, and other mouse functions.

This assistive device is suitable for users with spinal cord injury, MS, ALS,
and other disabilities that restrict arm movement.

# Device Compatibility

1.  Phone(Phone,Android 4.0+,iOS13+,Windows)

2.  Tablet(Android 4.0+,iPadOS+,Windows)

3.  Computer & Laptop (Windows,MacOS)

# Powering the LipSyn

The LipSync does not have an internal battery so it needs to be powered at all
times with an external power source. Users can draw power off of the device
(except on iOS devices) or use a power bank(>2700 mAh).

# Initialization

Allow 5 seconds for the LED initialization sequence to flash

**each time** the LipSync is plugged into a device. Ensure the mouthpiece
remains centred and untouched during this time.

# Connecting to a Device

**For computers and Android & Windows devices**, connect the LipSync USB into
the device. Use an adapter if necessary.

**For iOS devices**, connect the LipSync USB into a USB hub. Use a USB to USB
C/Lightning (depending on the device used) to connect the USB hub to your
device.

For more information, see *LipSync Mouse: Setup Guide*.
